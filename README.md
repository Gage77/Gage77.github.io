# Website Playground
Repository for website file

## Overview
This website will serve as a means of testing out new ideas and concepts that come to mind during my time as a developer. New areas will be added as I think of them, and will most likely all be an amalgamation of randomness (or whatever pops into my head that I think will be cool). Suggestions of what to make are always welcome.

### Intern-o-Matic 3000
This was created as a test of bootstrap and to amuse my coworkers during my internship at Alkami Technologies. It utilizes localStorage rather than a database, so the points listed are based on the local machine that is running them.
