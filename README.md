# Website Playground
Repository for website file

## Overview
This website will serve as a means of testing out new ideas and concepts that come to mind during my time as a developer. New areas will be added as I think of them, and will most likely all be an amalgamation of randomness (or whatever pops into my head that I think will be cool). Suggestions of what to make are always welcome.

### Whiskey Cork
This is my humble attempt at a blog on my deep dive into the wide world of whisk(e)y. I was first turned on to whiskey by stumbling across the [Whiskey Vault](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCElm866_W5r1eg8VjhFNARw) YouTube channel the year before I turned 21. After getting my first official whiskey on my 21st birthday (a delicious bottle of Monkey Shoulder), I was hooked. I have since grown my personal bar to include a number of fine whiskeys, and figured I would start writing down my personal tasting notes as my whiskey journey continues.

### Intern-o-Matic 3000
This was created as a test of bootstrap and to amuse my coworkers during my internship at Alkami Technologies. It utilizes localStorage rather than a database, so the points listed are based on the local machine that is running them.
